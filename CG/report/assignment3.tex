\section{Answer}
\subsection{Aliasing and Nyquist Frequency}
Given the delta function series $\delta_T (x)$, the fourier transform of the discrete sampling function $f_s(x)$ can be derived by Convolution theorem:
\begin{align}
\fourier{f_s(x)}
&= \sint[-\infty][\infty] f(x)\delta_T(x) e^{-i\omega x} \dx \\
&= F(\omega) \ast \fourier{\ssum[n][-\infty][\infty] \delta(t-nT)} \\
&= f^* \ssum[n][-\infty][\infty] F(\omega - nf^*) \label{result}
\end{align}
where $f^* = 1 / T$ denotes the Nyquist frequency. 

From equation \eqref{result}, we can observe that if $F(\omega) > 0$ when $\omega > f^* / 2$, each copy of $F$ will overlap with each other. This situation leads to a phenomenon called \tit{aliasing}, where we cannot distinguish low-frequency components from high-frequency ones due to overlapping in the frequency domain. For example, consider an image with its frequency domain representation as shown in Figure \ref{original}. When we increase sampling interval (or equivalently reduce sampling rate $f^*$), aliasing happens as illustrated in Figure \ref{aliasing}, especially on the roof tiles below the nameplate of the station.

\subsection{Anti-aliasing}
Suppose that the sampling rate is fixed, we can design a low-pass filter to remove the aliasing on the image. For example, we can use a Gaussian filter \eqref{gaussian-signal} and \eqref{gaussian-frequency} to smooth the image, assuming that $\sigma_x = \sigma_y = \sigma$.
\begin{subequations}
    \begin{gather}
        G(x,y) = \frac{1}{2\pi\sigma^2}e^{-\frac{x^2 + y^2}{2\sigma^2}} \label{gaussian-signal} \\
        \fourier{G(x,y)} = e^{-\frac{\sigma^2}{2}\parens*{\omega_x^2 + \omega_y^2}} \label{gaussian-frequency}
    \end{gather}
\end{subequations}

We apply the filter to an image by performing convolution between both of them. Or equivalently, sliding a finite representation of kernel across the image and adding results together in a discretized space. The principle behind this procedure is smoothing and removing high-frequency components from the image. Given that the standard deviation $\sigma$ is chosen appropriately, it is possible to reduce high-frequency components such that $F(\omega) = 0$ when $\omega > f^* / 2$; thus, mitigating the aliasing effect. Figure \ref{gaussian-image} demonstrates the application of the Gaussian filter.
